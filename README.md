# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS in React projects where the Tailwind classes do not seem to be applied correctly. The problem is likely due to one of the following reasons:

* **Incorrect configuration:** Ensure Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in your project (PostCSS, webpack/vite, etc.).
* **Missing PurgeCSS configuration:** If you're using PurgeCSS to remove unused Tailwind CSS classes, make sure the configuration correctly includes the paths to your React components.
* **Incorrect import of CSS:** Verify that Tailwind's CSS file is correctly imported into your application.
* **CSS specificity issues:** Other styles might be overriding Tailwind's styles due to higher specificity.
* **Incorrect use of Tailwind directives:** Ensure that your class names are correctly written according to Tailwind's naming conventions.
